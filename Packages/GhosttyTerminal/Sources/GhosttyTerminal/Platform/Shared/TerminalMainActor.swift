/// This exists for one narrow job: publishing a change that a view layout
/// produced. SwiftUI runs `layoutSubviews` inside its own update pass, so an
/// `@Published` mutation made from a layout-driven delegate callback lands
/// while SwiftUI is mid-update, and it says so — "Publishing changes from
/// within view updates is not allowed, this will cause undefined behavior."
/// Hopping to the next turn puts the mutation after the update pass has
/// finished, which is the only place it is legal.
///
/// Ordering is preserved: the main queue is FIFO, so two changes scheduled in
/// order are applied in that order. Use ``terminalRunOnMain`` for everything
/// else — work that merely needs *to be* on the main actor should not pay a
/// turn of latency for it.
